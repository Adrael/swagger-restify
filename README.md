{swagger-restify}
=========
This project is a fork of [swagger-restify](https://github.com/vellotis/swagger-restify)
project with Swagger compatibility improvements to make it possible to use it with
[restify](http://mcavage.me/node-restify/) framework. This implementation also makes use of [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) to validate generated swagger specs.

[Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is a specification and complete framework
implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.
View [demo](http://petstore.swagger.io/).

__{swagger-restify}__ is a simple and clean solution to integrate swagger with restify.

### Supported Swagger versions
  - __1.0__
  - __1.2__ (with validation)
  - __2.0__ (with validation)

## Installation

    $ npm install adrael/swagger-restify

## Otherwise

For pretty much anything else,
please read the [**old** documentation](https://github.com/vellotis/swagger-restify)
and the [official one](http://swagger.io/)
